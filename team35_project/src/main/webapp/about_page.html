	<div id="description">
		<p>Sign language is something that has changed the way of those that are<br>
		   hard of hearing communicate, as well as those who simply wish to learn the nature of <br> 
		   this language. Hand motions and facial expressions are key for conversation. However, <br>
		   sometimes sign language can be a little tricky to learn and master. This tool was designed <br>
		   to assist those learning the language, or may just need a refresher!</p>
